The solution involves understanding and adjusting the selectors to ensure the correct specificity. Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
/* Using more appropriate selectors to resolve conflicts. Note that you may need to adjust the order of selectors depending on the requirement */
#container {
  width: 300px;
}

.container {
  width: 200px;
}

.container #container {
  width: 100px; /* If you want this to be applied, make sure it is the most specific rule. Otherwise remove it*/
}

#container.container {
  width: 400px; /* If you want this to be applied, make sure it is the most specific rule. Otherwise remove it*/
}
```

This corrected CSS uses more specific selectors to ensure styles are applied predictably. The main goal is to avoid unexpected behavior and ensure the styles are applied as intended.
